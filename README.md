![license badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-brightgreen)

## Description

In this Module 13 Challenge, we were tasked to build the back-end for an e-commerce website! We took an [existing working Express.js API](https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/fantastic-umbrella) and configured it to interact with MySQL using the npm package Sequelize. You can peep my walkthrough video here: [Walkthrough Video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yTSH7QAv1dDj6KWegUHgSyVFrFIM70tX/view).
